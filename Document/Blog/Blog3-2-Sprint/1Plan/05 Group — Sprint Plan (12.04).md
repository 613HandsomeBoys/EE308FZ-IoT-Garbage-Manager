##### 1-1 Difficulties Encountered

1. We didn't know much about UML diagrams before, and we rarely tried to document the process without being required to do so.
2. Most of us have no team development experience and have not used teamwork tools, such as [Shimo Document](https://shimo.im/docs/ZzkLVdjKLnhM9a3Q) and [Github Teams](https://github.com/613HandsomeBoys).

##### 1-2 Relevant Solution

1. After querying and learning various types of UML diagrams, the UML diagram is drawn.
2. We held two offline meetings to update our progress and we have opened the online channel for efficient team collaboration.

| Opinions Record                          | Solution                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| For the garbage classification challenge | We have the experience to utilize ResNet to resolve this problem, which can be seen in [one of our pervious works](https://caihanlin.com/projects/). |
| For the battery issue of our IoT system  | As is the case with most of similar projects, we use battery to power our hardware. And in the future, we will consider adding solar panels to improve the cruising ability. |
